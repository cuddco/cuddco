I heard once that writer's block doesn't really exist, you just have to sit 
down and start writing. That's actually what I am doing right now. I'm actually
in the process of learning a new computer program called [Vim][vim wiki]. Vim 
is a text editor that at first glance it appears to be rather limited, but is 
in fact extremely powerful. Unfortunately to harness this power it takes a
great deal of training much like anything else worth while.

So on my quest to becoming a Vim master, I decided to start a blog for the soul
purpose of honing my Vim skills. I have been using Vim on and off for the past 
six months or so with varying degrees of success and utter frustration. With no
software projects at home to practice on a blog is fitting.

In order to be successful I needed to do all my blogging in the console, so I
looked into a blogging tool called [Jekyll][jekyll website]. It was developed 
by one of the Github founders and basically converts a bunch of Markdown files 
into a website. It was fairly simple to setup and it allows me to do all my 
work in the console using [Vim][vim wiki] and [Git][git website]. To upload my 
changes with a simple command called glynn. All of this is explained on the 
[Jekyll website][jekyll website].

It's a funny thing to hear people write so much about a simple text editor and 
to have so much passion for it. Everything I've read about Vim has really made
me curious about what all the hype is about. So here I am.
