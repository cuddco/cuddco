Well I'm no Vim master, and I haven't got a good handle on blogging either. I
have written a few draft articles and wasn't happy enough with them to publish
them. Maybe if this blog had a bit more focus, I would have more to write
about. Anyway I don't want to bore you with my ramblings. Action speaks louder
than words, you'll see soon enough.
