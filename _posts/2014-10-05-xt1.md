I was in the market for a new camera and after much research I decided on the
[Fujifilm X-T1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HYAL88W/ref=as_li_tl?

f/1.4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006UL00R6/ref=as_li_tl?

which is a pretty penny for a mirrorless camera. Despite the cost, this camera
is impressive. The viewfinder is amazing and manual focus assistance makes
manual focusing fast and pleasurable. The 35mm f1.4 lens produces stunning
photos with plenty of [bokeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"). ![Fuji X-T1](/assets/images/xt1.jpg "Fuji X-T1")

Here are the first set of photos I took out in my backyard. With manual
focusing you have precise control over what is in focus. Hopefully you will be
seeing more photos posted on here soon.
