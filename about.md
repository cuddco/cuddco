I started this blog in an effort to master Vim through continual practice while
at the same time producing a daily blog. I write about the things that interest
me which are typically related to computer programming, electronics,
open-source software, health, and hobbies. I hope you find something here you
enjoy. I love to hear feedback from my readers, feel free to [email
me](mailto:cuddco@gmail.com).
